| This is the source code for my personal website. Use gen.sh to process       |
| the files in the site directory into files in a directory called output.     |
| The output directory is what's actually hosted by the server.                |
|                                                                              |
| The site files may contain lines starting with several preprocessing         |
| directives prefixed with ###:                                                |
|                                                                              |

|                                                                              |

| End a code block                                                             |
|                                                                              |
| ###include file                                                              |
| Copy varbatim the contents of res/file                                       |
|                                                                              |

| This makes the preprocessor ignore whatever follows on this line             |
