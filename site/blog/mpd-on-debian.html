		<h1>Using MPD on Debian</h1>
		<p>
			MPD (Music Player Daemon) is one of the best solutions to playing music on GNU+Linux. There's a plethora of different GUI, TUI and CLI clients for it.
			It's great and all but setting it up on Debian is was (at least for me) a pain, so this article should help others trying to do it in the future.
			As a sidenote, you shouldn't use the version present in Debian Stable because it's <em>very</em> archaic. The one in the Debian Unstable repos is fine though.
		</p>
		<p>First of all, install mpd, mpc (the CLI client) and/or a client of your preference:</p>
###codeblock start
sudo apt install mpd mpc ncmpcpp
###codeblock end
		<p>Then create a config file for MPD in <code>~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf</code> that looks like this:</p>
###codeblock start
# Put the path to the directory with your music here (tylde is expanded to your homedir)
music_directory "~/Music"

# Output using Pulseaudio
audio_output {
	type "pulse"
	name "Pulseaudio output"
}

# You can also use ALSA or other backends; see mpd.conf(5)
#audio_output {
#	type "alsa"
#	name "ALSA output"
#}
###codeblock end
		<p>Next you should disable and stop the systemd service:</p>
###codeblock start
sudo systemctl disable mpd
sudo systemctl stop mpd mpd.socket # I'm not sure if you have to put mpd.socket here
###codeblock end
		<p>And finally, enable and start the systemd service, but not a system-wide one:</p>
###codeblock start
systemctl --user enable mpd
systemctl --user start mpd mpd.socket # Again I'm not sure if you have to put mpd.socket here
###codeblock end
		<p>
			And you're good to go. MPD will start on user login, and it will work with Pulseaudio (it doesn't work as a non-user service).
			You can test if your music is seen by MPD by running <code>mpc listall | pager</code>, which lists all scanned files.
