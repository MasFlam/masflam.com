		<h1>Extrepo â€“ external apt repository manager</h1>
		<p>
			Not all software is available in Debian's repositories, not even in Unstable or Experimental.
			Some software creators provide downloads of </code>.deb</code>s, and some host their own
			apt repositories. Extrepo exists to help in the latter case. It's a tool for managing
			these external repositories, without the need for unsigned shell scripts or copy-pasting
			commands to your terminal.
		</p>
		<h3 id=installation>Installation and configuration</h3>
		<p>
			You can install Extrepo from apt (<code>apt install extrepo</code>).
			By default only repositories with software meeting the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)
			licensing requirements can be used and searched. To change that, in <code>/etc/extrepo/config.yaml</code>
			uncomment the lines with <code>contrib</code> (for DFSG-free software that has non-DFSG-free dependencies),
			and/or <code>non-free</code> (for non-DFSG-free packages).
		</p>
		<h3 id=usage>Usage</h3>
		<p>
			You can get a list of all external repositories Extrepo knows about with <code>extrepo search</code>,
			and you can search for a regular expression by passing in a third argument. It's a long list,
			so if you don't need all the details for all repositories, you can pipe it through grep
			(<code> | grep '^Found'</code>). If the repository you want is on the list, great! You can
			enable it with <code>extrepo enable repository-name</code> (ran as root). Similarly, to disable
			a previously enabled repository, use <code>extrepo disable repository-name</code>. If a repository
			stops working or some metadata about it changes, use <code>extrepo update repository-name</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But what if the external repository you're looking for isn't there? Well, you will have to
			add it yourself. See, the data about repositories comes from the
			<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/extrepo-team/extrepo-data"><code>extrepo-data</code></a> git repository,
			hosted on Debian's GitLab instance, <a href="https://salsa.debian.org">Salsa</a>. To add a repository
			to Extrepo, you need an account there. Creating one will usually take you a day, since the admin
			has to approve it. After you create an account, you will have to go to the git repository
			page and fork it. Then <code>git clone</code> your fork onto your machine and create a new file in
			<code>repos/debian</code> named after your external repository. Copy over the contents from another
			file in there, and looking at how other files are structured, edit the appropriate data.
			There isn't a comprehensive guide on this, but some pattern recognition is enough not to screw up badly.
